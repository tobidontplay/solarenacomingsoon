## Reply Summary
Vite marketing site, library routes, partner form, Netlify and Vercel mentions, no tests, no Vite port, description says temporary.

Added the Prompt 1 governance scaffold where it was missing, filled architecture, the project brief, the case study, and feature specs from the tree (Prompt 1b), then added Ariadne files: project.yaml, TODO.md, docs/verification.md, docs/learning/quiz-log.jsonl, and an upgraded concepts table. Feature specs carry frontmatter. No application code was edited.
## Full Reply / Key Excerpts
This repo's structure before the pass: structure_status none..
After the pass the Ariadne contract is present: a root project.yaml, a verification log with an empty table, quiz-log schema, and feature frontmatter capped at stage `implemented`.
Run command recorded as npm run dev. Test command recorded as "TODO: confirm — no tests detected"  # no test script and no test files. Port recorded as None.
## Considerations
- project.yaml exists so a monitor can start, test, and build this repo without reading the README. A README that says "npm i && npm run dev" is not a contract.
- docs/verification.md exists so "done" means tests, a manual check, and a user opinion, each recorded. A feature spec with Status: Done is not that record.
- Feature frontmatter exists so stage and validation are machine-readable. Prose status lines drift. The body of each spec was kept.
- Included because the approved table contained it. The temp label stays in the docs.
## Alternatives Considered
- Alternative A: one shared project.yaml for the whole GitHub account. Rejected because run, test, port, and watch directories differ per repo, and a monitor that guesses the wrong command will mark a healthy repo as down.
- Alternative B: a database instead of frontmatter. Rejected because the spec file in git is the review surface, and Ariadne can read a checkout without operating a second store. A database would also hide status from anyone reading the pull request.
## Learning Notes (For the Human)
- Concept introduced: a fleet contract. Same file names in every repo, different values, no invented test commands.
- Why it matters: a junior dev copying one README across repos ships a monitor that runs `npm test` in a repo that has no tests, then reports failure as a product bug.
- Where to read more: project.yaml in this repo, docs/verification.md, and specs/features/*.md frontmatter.
